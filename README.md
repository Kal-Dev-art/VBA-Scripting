# VBA-Scripting
 I have used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 
 My script can run on all sheets successfully, as required! I also managed to retrieve the data which includes the ticker symbol, volume of stock, open and closing price. I've also successfully applied the conditional formatting appropriately, and were able to create new columns that were required.
